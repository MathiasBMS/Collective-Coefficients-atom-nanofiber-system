# Collective-Coefficients-atom-nanofiber-system

% This MATLAB code aims to calculate the coefficients in the master equation for a
system of atoms residing above the surface of a single-mode nanofiber as 
a function of the interatomic distance a using the methods presented in the 
paper: Modified dipole-dipole interactions in the presence of a nanophotonic 
waveguide. This is done by splitting the coefficients into guided and radiation
contribution. The guided contribution is calculated analytically, while the 
radiation contribution is calculated by performing the numerical scheme 
presented in the paper.

% Any use of this code should come with a reference to the paper.
